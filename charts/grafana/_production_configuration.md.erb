This chart includes a *values-production.yaml* file where you can find some parameters oriented to production configuration in comparison to the regular *values.yaml*. You can use this file instead of the default one.

* Enable ingress controller:

    - ingress.enabled: false
    + ingress.enabled: true

* Enable exposing Prometheus metrics:

    - metrics.enabled: false
    + metrics.enabled: true

### Using custom configuration

Grafana supports multiples configuration files. Using kubernetes you can mount a file using a ConfigMap or a Secret. For example, to mount a custom grafana.ini file or custom.ini file you can create a ConfigMap like the following:

~~~
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: myconfig
data:
  grafana.ini: |-
    # Raw text of the file
~~~

And now you need to pass the ConfigMap name, to the corresponding parameters: config.useGrafanaIniFile=true and config.grafanaIniConfigMap=myconfig.

To provide dashboards on deployment time, Grafana needs a dashboards provider and the dashboards themselves. A default provider is created if enabled, or you can mount your own provider using a ConfigMap, but have in mind that the path to the dashboard folder must be */opt/bitnami/grafana/dashboards*.

To create a dashboard, it is needed to have a datasource for it. The datasources must be created mounting a secret with all the datasource files in it. In this case, it is not a ConfigMap because the datasource could contain sensitive information.

To load the dashboards themselves you need to create a ConfigMap for each one containing the json file that defines the dashboard and set the array with the ConfigMap names into the dashboardsConfigMaps parameter. Note the difference between the datasources and the dashboards creation. For the datasources we can use just one secret with all of the files, while for the dashboards we need one ConfigMap per file.

For example, create the dashboard ConfigMap(s) and datasource Secret as described below:

~~~
$ kubectl create secret generic datasource-secret --from-file=datasource-secret.yaml
$ kubectl create configmap my-dashboard-1 --from-file=my-dashboard-1.json
$ kubectl create configmap my-dashboard-2 --from-file=my-dashboard-2.json
~~~

> NOTE: The commands above assume you had previously exported your dashboards in the JSON files: *my-dashboard-1.json* and *my-dashboard-2.json*. Also, they assume you had previously created a datasource config file *datasource-secret.yaml*. Find an example in the [Grafana official documentation] (https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/#example-datasource-config-file)

Once you have them, use the following parameters to deploy Grafana with two custom dashboards:

~~~
dashboardsProvider.enabled=true
datasources.secretName=datasource-secret
dashboardsConfigMaps[0].configMapName=my-dashboard-1
dashboardsConfigMaps[0].fileName=my-dashboard-1.json
dashboardsConfigMaps[1].configMapName=my-dashboard-2
dashboardsConfigMaps[1].fileName=my-dashboard-2.json
~~~
