The [Bitnami Parse image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-parse) allows you to deploy your Cloud functions with Parse Cloud Code (a feature which allows running a piece of code in your Parse Server instead of the user's mobile devices). In order to add your custom scripts, they must be located inside the chart folder *files/cloud* so they can be consumed as a ConfigMap.

Alternatively, you can specify custom scripts using the cloudCodeScripts parameter as dict.

In addition to these options, you can also set an external ConfigMap with all the Cloud Code scripts. This is done by setting the *existingCloudCodeScriptsCM* parameter. Note that this will override the two previous options.
