To scale down the MySQL cluster just perform a normal upgrade setting the *slave.replicas* value to the desired number of nodes. For example, reduce the cluster to the default one replica:

~~~
$ helm upgrade bitnami/mysql \
set rootUser.password=ROOT_PASSWORD \
--set slave.replicas=1 \
~~~

> NOTE: You need to substitute the placeholder ROOT_PASSWORD with the value obtained from instructions in the installation notes. Also replace NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS with the total number of nodes you want to set for the existing cluster.
