Cert Manager supports issuing certificates through different Issuers. For instance, you can use a Self Signed Issuer to issue the certificates.

The Self Signed issuer doesn't represent a certificate authority as such, but instead denotes that certificates will "sign themselves" using a given private key.

> NOTE: Find the list of available Issuers in the [Cert Manager official documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/#supported-issuer-types).

To configure Cert Manager, create an Issuer object. The structure of this object differs depending on the Issuer type. Self Signed issuer are really easy to configure.

To create a self signed issuer to generate a self signed certificate, declare an Issuer, a ClusterIssuer and a Certificate, as shown below:

~~~
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-ca
  namespace: sandbox
spec:
  ca:
    secretName: letsencrypt-ca
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-ca
  namespace: sandbox
spec:
  isCA: true
  commonName: osm-system
  secretName: letsencrypt-ca
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-prod
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    group: cert-manager.io
~~~

Next, use the ClusterIssuer to generate certificates for the applications in your Kubernetes cluster. [Learn how to secure your Ingress resources](<%= platform_path %>/infrastructure/cert-manager/configuration/secure-ingress-resources).

After the Ingress resource is ready, Cert Manager will create a secret whose content is the TLS certificate generated. This can be checked as shown below:

~~~
$ k get secret --namespace=sandbox
NAME                  TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
letsencrypt-ca        kubernetes.io/tls                     3      Xs
~~~
