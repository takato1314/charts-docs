To add a new node to your PostgreSQL HA cluster, you need to upgrade your installation by providing some parameters to the *helm upgrade* command:

* Pass as password the *password* used in the installation time. If you did not provide a password follow the intructions from the NOTES.txt to get the generated password.
* Set the desired number of nodes at *replicaCount*.
* Use the *--replicaCount* flag to modify the number of nodes in your PostgreSQL-HA deployment.
* Replace *bitnami/postgresql* with *bitnami/postgresql-repmgr* which includes and configures *repmgr*. Repmgr ensures standby nodes assume the primary role when the primary node is unhealthy.

The following will be an example to add more nodes:

~~~
$ helm upgrade my-release bitnami/postgresql-ha \
--set password=POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD \
--set repmgrPassword=REPMGR_PASSWORD \
--set replicaCount=NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS \
--set upgradeRepmgrExtension=true
~~~

> NOTE: You need to substitute the placeholders POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD, and [REPMGR_PASSWORD] with the values obtained from instructions in the installation notes. Also replace NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS with the total number of nodes you want to add to the existing cluster.
