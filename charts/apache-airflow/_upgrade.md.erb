### To 13.0.0

This major update the Redis&trade; subchart to its newest major, 17.0.0, which updates Redis&trade; from its version 6.2 to the latest 7.0.

### To 12.0.0

This major release renames several values in this chart and adds missing features, in order to be inline with the rest of assets in the Bitnami charts repository. Additionally updates the PostgreSQL & Redis subcharts to their newest major 11.x.x and 16.x.x, respectively, which contain similar changes.

#### What changes were introduced in this major version?

* *auth.forcePassword* parameter is deprecated. The new version uses Helm's lookup functionalities and forcing passwords isn't required anymore.
* *config* and *configurationConfigMap* have been renamed to *configuration* and *existingConfigmap*, respectively.
* *dags.configMap* and *web.configMap* have been renamed to *dags.existingConfigmap* and *web.existingConfigmap*, respectively.
* *web.containerPort* and *worker.port* have been regrouped under the *web.containerPorts* and *worker.containerPorts* maps, respectively.
* *web.podDisruptionBudget*, *scheduler.podDisruptionBudget* and *worker.podDisruptionBudget* maps have been renamed to *web.pdb*, *scheduler.pdb* and *worker.pdb*, respectively.
* *worker.autoscaling.replicas.min*, *worker.autoscaling.replicas.max*, *worker.autoscaling.targets.cpu* and *worker.autoscaling.targets.memory* have been renamed to *worker.autoscaling.minReplicas*, *worker.autoscaling.maxReplicas*, *worker.autoscaling.targetCPU* and *.Values.worker.autoscaling.targetMemory*, respectively.
* *service.port* and *service.httpsPort* have been regrouped under the *service.ports* map.
* *ingress* map is completely redefined.
* *metrics.service.port* has been regrouped under the *metrics.service.ports* map.
* Support for Network Policies is dropped and it'll be properly added in the future.
* The secret keys *airflow-fernetKey* and *airflow-secretKey* were renamed to *airflow-fernet-key* and *airflow-secret-key*, respectively.

#### Upgrading Instructions

To upgrade to *12.0.0* from *11.x*, it should be done reusing the PVC(s) used to hold the data on your previous release. To do so, follow the instructions below (the following example assumes that the release name is *airflow* and the release namespace *default*):

> NOTE: Please, create a backup of your database before running any of those actions.

1. Obtain the credentials and the names of the PVCs used to hold the data on your current release:

        export AIRFLOW_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default airflow -o jsonpath="{.data.airflow-password}" | base64 --decode)
        export AIRFLOW_FERNET_KEY=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default airflow -o jsonpath="{.data.airflow-fernetKey}" | base64 --decode)
        export AIRFLOW_SECRET_KEY=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default airflow -o jsonpath="{.data.airflow-secretKey}" | base64 --decode)
        export POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default airflow-postgresql -o jsonpath="{.data.postgresql-password}" | base64 --decode)
        export REDIS_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default airflow-redis -o jsonpath="{.data.redis-password}" | base64 --decode)
        export POSTGRESQL_PVC=$(kubectl get pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=airflow,app.kubernetes.io/name=postgresql,role=primary -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

2. Delete the Airflow worker & PostgreSQL statefulset (notice the option *--cascade=false*) and secrets:

        kubectl delete statefulsets.apps --cascade=false airflow-postgresql
        kubectl delete statefulsets.apps --cascade=false airflow-worker
        kubectl delete secret postgresql --namespace default
        kubectl delete secret airflow --namespace default

3. Upgrade your release using the same PostgreSQL version:

        CURRENT_PG_VERSION=$(kubectl exec airflow-postgresql-0 -- bash -c 'echo $BITNAMI_IMAGE_VERSION')
        helm upgrade airflow bitnami/airflow \
          --set loadExamples=true \
          --set web.baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
          --set auth.password=$AIRFLOW_PASSWORD \
          --set auth.fernetKey=$AIRFLOW_FERNET_KEY \
          --set auth.secretKey=$AIRFLOW_SECRET_KEY \
          --set postgresql.image.tag=$CURRENT_VERSION \
          --set postgresql.auth.password=$POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD \
          --set postgresql.persistence.existingClaim=$POSTGRESQL_PVC \
          --set redis.password=$REDIS_PASSWORD \
          --set redis.cluster.enabled=true

4. Delete the existing Airflow worker & PostgreSQL pods and the new statefulset will create a new one:

        kubectl delete pod airflow-postgresql-0
        kubectl delete pod airflow-worker-0

### To 11.0.0

This major update the Redis&trade; subchart to its newest major, 15.0.0. [Here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis#to-1500) you can find more info about the specific changes.

### To 10.0.0

This major updates the Redis&trade; subchart to it newest major, 14.0.0, which contains breaking changes. For more information on this subchart's major and the steps needed to migrate your data from your previous release, please refer to [Redis&trade; upgrade notes.](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis#to-1400).

### To 7.0.0

[On November 13, 2020, Helm v2 support was formally finished](https://github.com/helm/charts#status-of-the-project), this major version is the result of the required changes applied to the Helm Chart to be able to incorporate the different features added in Helm v3 and to be consistent with the Helm project itself regarding the Helm v2 EOL.

#### What changes were introduced in this major version?

* Previous versions of this Helm Chart use `apiVersion: v1` (installable by both Helm 2 and 3), this Helm Chart was updated to `apiVersion: v2` (installable by Helm 3 only). [Here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-apiversion-field) you can find more information about the `apiVersion` field.
* Move dependency information from the *requirements.yaml* to the *Chart.yaml*
* After running *helm dependency update*, a *Chart.lock* file is generated containing the same structure used in the previous *requirements.lock*
* The different fields present in the *Chart.yaml* file has been ordered alphabetically in a homogeneous way for all the Bitnami Helm Chart.
* Several parameters were renamed or disappeared in favor of new ones on this major version:
  * The image objects have been moved to its corresponding component object, e.g: *workerImage* now is located at *worker.image*.
  * The prefix *airflow* has been removed. Therefore, parameters prefixed with *airflow* are now at root level, e.g. *airflow.loadExamples* now is *loadExamples* or *airflow.worker.resources* now is *worker.resources*.
  * Parameters related to the *git* features has completely been refactored:
    * They have been regrouped under the *git* map.
    * *airflow.cloneDagsFromGit* no longer exists, instead you must use *git.dags* and *git.dags.repositories* has been introduced that will add support for multiple repositories.
    * *airflow.clonePluginsFromGit* no longer exists, instead you must use *git.plugins*. *airflow.clonePluginsFromGit.repository*, *airflow.clonePluginsFromGit.branch* and *airflow.clonePluginsFromGit.path* have been removed in favour of *git.dags.repositories*.
  * Liveness and readiness probe have been separated by components *airflow.livenessProbe.** and *airflow.readinessProbe* have been removed in favour of *web.livenessProbe*, *worker.livenessProbe*, *web.readinessProbe* and *worker.readinessProbe*.
  * *airflow.baseUrl* has been moved to *web.baseUrl*.
  * Security context has been migrated to the bitnami standard way so that *securityContext* has been divided into *podSecurityContext* that will define the **fsGroup** for all the containers in the pod and *containerSecurityContext* that will define the user id that will run the main containers.
  * *./files/dags/*.py* will not be include in the deployment any more.
* Additionally updates the PostgreSQL & Redis subcharts to their newest major 10.x.x and 11.x.x, respectively, which contain similar changes.

#### Considerations when upgrading to this version

* If you want to upgrade to this version using Helm v2, this scenario is not supported as this version does not support Helm v2 anymore.
* If you installed the previous version with Helm v2 and wants to upgrade to this version with Helm v3, please refer to the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/#migration-use-cases) about migrating from Helm v2 to v3.

        helm upgrade airflow bitnami/airflow \
