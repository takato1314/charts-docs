The service(s) created by the deployment can be exposed within or outside the cluster using any of the following approaches:

* Ingress: This requires an Ingress controller to be installed in the Kubernetes cluster. Set *\*.ingress.enabled=true* to expose the corresponding service(s) through Ingress. <% if there_is "../../configuration/configure-ingress" %>[Learn more about configuring and using Ingress](../../configuration/configure-ingress).<% end %>

* Cluster IP address: This exposes the service(s) on a cluster-internal IP address. This approach makes the corresponding service(s) reachable only from within the cluster. Set *\*.service.type=ClusterIP* to choose this approach.

* Node port: This exposes the service() on each node's IP address at a static port (the NodePort). This approach makes the corresponding service(s) reachable from outside the cluster, by requesting the static port using the node's IP address, such as *NODE-IP:NODE-PORT*. Set *\*.service.type=NodePort* to choose this approach.

* Load balancer IP address: This exposes the service(s) externally using a cloud provider's load balancer. Set *\*.service.type=LoadBalancer* to choose this approach.
