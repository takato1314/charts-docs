To deploy applications in the cluster, it is necessary to first connect to it. To do this, follow the steps below:

  * Click the "Access this cluster" button in the navigation panel.
  * Click the "click here" link. Following this link takes you to a page with instructions to download and install the Tanzu Mission Control Command-Line Interface (CLI) (*tmc*).

      <%= documentation_img '/images/img/platforms/kubernetes/get-started-tmc/tmc-cluster-access-instructions-1.png', 'Download TMC CLI' %>

  * On the resulting page, click "Download CLI" and download the CLI for your platform.
  * Once the download is complete, move the downloaded binary to a directory in your execution path using the instructions shown for your platform.
  * Execute the command below to start the Tanzu Mission Control CLI:

          $ tmc login

      You will be prompted for an API token. If you have one, enter it at the prompt or, if not, create a new token as described below.

  * Navigate to the displayed URL, where you will be further prompted for various inputs to create an API token for Tanzu Mission Control.
    * Enter a context name. This name must match your TMC organization domain.
    * Select the default values unless you prefer different ones.

    Your API token will be created and displayed. Copy the API token and enter it in the Tanzu Mission Control CLI to complete the CLI login process.

  * Navigate back to the cluster detail page in Tanzu Mission Control. From the "Access this cluster" dialog box, click "Download Kubeconfig file" and configure *kubectl* to connect to the cluster by executing the command below:

      <%= documentation_img '/images/img/platforms/kubernetes/get-started-tmc/tmc-cluster-access-instructions-2.png', 'Download Kubeconfig file' %>

      A new window will open in your browser to confirm that the TMC login flow is complete.

      <%= documentation_img '/images/img/platforms/kubernetes/get-started-tmc/tmc-login.png', 'TMC Access cluster complete process' %>

  * Confirm that you are able to successfully access the cluster by running the *kubectl cluster-info* command.
